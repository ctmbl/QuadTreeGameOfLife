# QuadTreeGameOfLife

In this directory, you'll find an implementation of Conway's Game of Life (GoL). The simulation is written in C language and uses SDL graphic library.

## 1 Project Presentation. [[toc](https://github.com/Supaero-Computer-Science-Club/QuadTreeGameOfLife)]
This project aims to implement the GoL using **QuadTree** to store cells and the whole universe. The final goal is to compare it to implementations which use arrays (naive implementation), linked-list or others type of structure, at different scale and universe density in terms of **computing duration** and **computing cost**. Every implementation must be in C to compare the effectiveness of the structure not the one of the language.

## 3 Run the code. [[toc](https://github.com/Supaero-Computer-Science-Club/QuadTreeGameOfLife)]
To run the program you'll need the `gcc` compiler, the `SDL` library and to run `make app` in the root folder of the project.
